# Contributing to tabulint

Thanks for considering a contribution. `tabulint` is deliberately small: standard
library only, simple functions, small modules. Contributions that keep it that way
are the most welcome kind.

You do **not** need write access to this repository. Every contribution goes
through a fork and a pull request.

## 1. Fork the repository

Use the **Fork** button on <https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az>,
or the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo fork ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az --clone=false
```

## 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tabulint-oss-az.git
cd tabulint-oss-az
```

## 3. Add the upstream remote

This lets you keep your fork in sync with the original project.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az.git
git remote -v
```

Before starting new work, refresh your `main`:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
```

## 4. Set up a development environment

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
```

On Windows Command Prompt, activate the environment with:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## 5. Create a focused branch

Use one branch per issue, with a short descriptive name. Replace `123` in the
examples below with your issue number:

```bash
git checkout -b issue-123-short-description
```

## 6. Implement one focused issue

Pick an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az/issues).
Check its discussion, assignee, and linked pull requests, then comment with
your intended approach before starting. Some issues have a longer description
in [CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md](CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md). Follow the issue's acceptance
criteria and keep unrelated changes out of the pull request.

Style notes:

- Standard library only; do not add runtime dependencies.
- Prefer a plain function over a new class or abstraction.
- Match the surrounding code: short modules, short functions, few comments.
- Update `README.md` when you change user-visible behavior.
- For user-visible behavior changes, add a brief entry under `Unreleased` in
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Documentation-only, test-only, and internal maintenance changes
  generally do not need an entry.
- Code assistants are welcome. Review the diff yourself, run the tests, and be
  able to explain the change you submit.

## 7. Run the tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

For a focused change, run the affected test module first, then run the full
suite before pushing:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_<module>.py
python -m pytest
```

If the editable install is unavailable, the command-line entry point can be
checked from the checkout with `python -m tabulint --help`. Report the Python
version, platform, command, and complete error output when setup or tests fail.

Run the whole suite before you push, not only the tests you added. Every pull
request must leave the suite green.

## 8. Commit

Write a commit message that describes the software change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change clearly"
```

Good subjects are imperative and specific: `Add allowed-values validation`,
`Improve malformed JSON errors`, `Fix boolean inference for yes/no`. Avoid
`update`, `fix stuff`, or `wip`. Do not add attribution trailers for tooling you
used; commit under your own Git identity.

## 9. Push to your fork

```bash
git push -u origin issue-123-short-description
```

## 10. Open a pull request against upstream `main`

```bash
gh pr create --repo ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az --base main
```

Or use the "Compare & pull request" button GitHub shows after the push.

In the pull-request description, state the problem, the change you made, and the
tests you ran. Reference the issue so it closes on merge:

```
Closes #123
```

## Review

A maintainer will review the pull request and may ask for changes. Push new
commits to the same branch; the pull request updates automatically.

## Reporting bugs and ideas

Open an issue using one of the templates in
[.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). For anything security-related,
follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
