# Contributing to tabulint

Thanks for considering a contribution. `tabulint` is deliberately small: standard
library only, simple functions, small modules. Contributions that keep it that way
are the most welcome kind.

You do **not** need write access to this repository. Every contribution goes
through a fork and a pull request.

## 1. Fork the repository

Use the **Fork** button on <https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az>,
or the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo fork ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az --clone=false
```

## 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tabulint-oss-az.git
cd tabulint-oss-az
```

## 3. Add the upstream remote

This lets you keep your fork in sync with the original project.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az.git
git remote -v
```

Before starting new work, refresh your `main`:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
```

## 4. Set up a development environment

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment for your shell:

```bash
# Linux or macOS (bash/zsh)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```bat
REM Windows Command Prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then install the project and run its tests:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest
```

## 5. Create a focused branch

Use one branch per issue, with a short descriptive name. Replace `123` in the
examples below with your issue number:

```bash
git checkout -b issue-123-short-description
```

## 6. Implement one focused issue

Pick an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az/issues).
Check its discussion, assignee, and linked pull requests, then comment with
your intended approach before starting. Some issues have a longer description
in [CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md](CONTRIBUTOR_TASKS.md). Follow the issue's acceptance
criteria and keep unrelated changes out of the pull request.

Style notes:

- Standard library only; do not add runtime dependencies.
- Prefer a plain function over a new class or abstraction.
- Match the surrounding code: short modules, short functions, few comments.
- Update `README.md` when you change user-visible behavior.
- For user-visible behavior changes, add a brief entry under `Unreleased` in
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Documentation-only, test-only, and internal maintenance changes
  generally do not need an entry.
- Code assistants are welcome. Review the diff yourself, run the tests, and be
  able to explain the change you submit.

### Changelog entries

For a user-visible change, add one short bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in
`CHANGELOG.md`. Put a new feature under `### Added`, a behavior change under
`### Changed`, a deprecation under `### Deprecated`, a removed feature under
`### Removed`, a bug fix under `### Fixed`, or a security fix under
`### Security`. Add the heading if it is missing. Describe the effect for users
in the present tense; leave version numbers and release dates to the maintainer.
For example, a fix for an error that used to be hidden could be:

```markdown
### Fixed

- Report malformed CSV quoting as an error instead of accepting an incomplete record.
```

Documentation-only, test-only, and internal maintenance changes generally do
not need a changelog entry. Maintainers move the `Unreleased` entries into a
dated release section when they publish a release; see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## 7. Run the tests

Run one test while iterating, then its file and the full suite before pushing:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_clean_csv_exits_zero
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py
python -m pytest
```

After the editable install, try the CLI from the checkout:

```bash
tabulint --help
python -m tabulint.cli --help
```

The second command works when the `tabulint` console script is not on `PATH`.

### Setup problems

- If installation rejects your Python version, run `python --version` and
  recreate `.venv` using Python 3.11 or newer.
- If `tabulint` is missing or Python cannot import it, activate `.venv` and
  rerun `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`; use `python -m tabulint.cli --help`
  if only the console script is missing.
- If PowerShell blocks `Activate.ps1`, run
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process RemoteSigned` and activate it again.

When asking for help, include your Python version, platform, failing command,
and complete error output.

## 8. Commit

Write a commit message that describes the software change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change clearly"
```

Good subjects are imperative and specific: `Add allowed-values validation`,
`Improve malformed JSON errors`, `Fix boolean inference for yes/no`. Avoid
`update`, `fix stuff`, or `wip`. Do not add attribution trailers for tooling you
used; commit under your own Git identity.

## 9. Push to your fork

```bash
git push -u origin issue-123-short-description
```

## 10. Open a pull request against upstream `main`

```bash
gh pr create --repo ismayilzeynal/tabulint-oss-az --base main
```

Or use the "Compare & pull request" button GitHub shows after the push.

In the pull-request description, state the problem, the change you made, and the
tests you ran. Reference the issue so it closes on merge:

```
Closes #123
```

## Review

A maintainer will review the pull request and may ask for changes. Push new
commits to the same branch; the pull request updates automatically.

## Reporting bugs and ideas

Open an issue using one of the templates in
[.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). For anything security-related,
follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
